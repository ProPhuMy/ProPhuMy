## Hello
I'm still a high school student. I code because I got no other hobbies to do. I want to escape life so bad, shit's too stressful. But whatever, if I ever succeed in my love life then maybe I won't have to fantasize about living in a dark fantasy world. 

## Some shit to make this profile a bit livelier:
- I'm learning other languages other than Python at the moment.
- If you want to collaborate, please don't contact me. I don't think I will be willing to do something as a team at the moment
- Fun fact: I like cats. Yeah that's it.
